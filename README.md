## 🧩 What it is

**market.fun** is a simple **prediction market platform** where anyone can create a market and bet on future events.  
It’s like **pump.fun**, but instead of memecoins, you create **YES/NO markets**.

---

## ⚙️ How it works

1. **Create a market** → define a question (e.g. “Will ETH > $4k by Dec 31?”)  
2. **Buy shares** → choose **YES** or **NO** (1 token = 1 share)  
3. **Wait for result** → after resolution, winners take all  

Simple, transparent, and permissionless.

## 💡 Why

Prediction markets are often complex or closed.  
**market.fun** makes them easy, fast, and open to everyone — built for the **Scroll** ecosystem.
